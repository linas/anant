This project contains ad-hoc implementations of assorted analytic
functions of interest in number theory, including the gamma function,
the Riemann zeta function, the polylogarithm, and the Minkowski 
question mark function. The implementation uses the Gnu Multi-Precision
library (GMP) to perform all low-level operations.  The code herein
is licensed under the terms of the Gnu GPLv3 license.

This project is *NOT* meant to be a replacement for other, more
established multi-precision systems, such as PARI/GP.  It is meant to 
be a staging area for implementations of functions that have not (yet)
received much attention in the more established packages. Users are
strongly encouraged to port the contents of this package to other
systems.

This package has its origins as a collection of tools & utilities for 
the benefit of the author.  As such, it was never really intended for
public consumption, and thus, will not have the usual amenities of
established projects, such as clear documentation, a website, unit 
test cases, or even a robust build system.  Caveat Emptor!
