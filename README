This project contains ad-hoc implementations of assorted analytic
functions of interest in number theory, including the gamma function,
the Riemann zeta function, the polylogarithm, and the Minkowski 
question mark function. The implementation uses the Gnu Multi-Precision
library (GMP) to perform all low-level operations.  The code herein
is licensed under the terms of the Gnu GPLv3 license.

This project is *NOT* meant to be a replacement for other, more
established multi-precision systems, such as PARI/GP.  It is meant to 
be a staging area for implementations of functions that have not (yet)
received much attention in the more established packages. Users are
strongly encouraged to port the contents of this package to other
systems.

A note about floating-point exceptions: many of the special functions
computed here have poles at various values.  These will show up as
mysterious floating-point exceptions deep within the code.  If you
get an exception, make sure you are not evaluating a function at a pole!

This package has its origins as a collection of tools & utilities for 
the benefit of the author.  As such, it was never really intended for
public consumption, and thus, will not have the usual amenities of
established projects, such as clear documentation, a website, unit 
test cases, or even a robust build system.  Caveat Emptor!

There are several publications that describe this code, or make use of
it. The most notable is this:

the convergence of oscillatory series, useful for computing the
polylogarithm and Hurwitz zeta functions". Numerical Algorithms

Pre-requisites, Compiling, Installing, Testing
----------------------------------------------
This package requires a copy of the Berkeley DB database to be
available. The database is used to cache certain intermediate values, to
improve performance of various internal algorithms.

This package has minimal build support. cd to the src directory, and
'make'.  If you want to install the files somewhere, you will have to do
this by hand, or custom-tailor to suit your needs.

There is a unit test, rather ad-hoc in nature, and it is not
"user-freindly".  It will report some errors in the last few decimal
places of various routines, depending on how it was invoked. It is up
to you to figure out if these are serious errors or not.  Caveat Emptor!

(I mean, its 'error-free' for me, i.e. 'good enough'.  There is nothing
in here that is horribly broken, as far as I know.  If quibbling over
the last few decimal places is important to you, you might have a
different opinion.)


Precision
---------
Most of the algorithms deal with precision issues in a fairly ad-hoc
kind of way.  Many/most routines require an argument specifying the 
number of decimal places of desired precision, and will typically 
return answers that are accurate from about 90% to 100% of the specified
precision. However, many of the algorithms use internal, intermediate 
results that need to be maintained at a higher level of precision than
the "desired" precision. Thus, correct usage requires that the user
specify an mpf_set_default_prec() that is 10% to 50% larger than the
desired precision of the results.  The proper amount to use is up to
you to figure out!  A reasonable rule-of-thumb seems to be to use 
mpf_set_default_prec(5*desired_decimal_places) -- noting that log_2(10)
is 2.3.


Example Usage
-------------
The example below shows an example of how to use the functions
in this library.

      // Standard include headers
      #include <gmp.h>
      #include <stdio.h>
      #include "mp-polylog.h"
      #include "mp-misc.h"
      
      int main()
      {
         cpx_t plog, ess, zee;
         int nbits;
         int decimal_prec;
      
         // decimal_prec is the number of decimal places of desired
         // precision.
         //
         // 3.3 is equal to log_2(10), and is used to convert decimal
         // places to number of binary bits.
         //
         // The +600 adds some extra "padding precision" for 
         // intermediate calculations. Most algorithms require some
         // fair amount of additional bits of precision to be used in
         // computing intermediate results.  The precise amount needed
         // is somewhat ad-hoc, and not well-characterized for the
         // different functions; typically, an extra 20% to 50% is
         // needed.
         //
         decimal_prec = 500;
         nbits = 3.3*decimal_prec + 600;
         mpf_set_default_prec (nbits);
         
         // Initialization
         cpx_init (plog);
         cpx_init (ess);
         cpx_init (zee);
      
         // Set values for which computation will be done.
         cpx_set_d(ess, 2.1, 0.0);
         cpx_set_d(zee, 0.5, 0.0);
      
         // Compute ... 
         int rc = cpx_polylog(plog, ess, zee, decimal_prec);
      
         // Check for error conditions
         if (0 != rc)
         {
         	printf("Error occured during computation! rc=%d\n", rc);
         	return 1;
         }
         cpx_prt("Answer is ", plog);
         printf("\n");
      
         return 0;
      }
